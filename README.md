# Drop-ET assignment
This is an assignment from Drop-ET, a last mile shipment company. 

## Description
The goal of this project was to achieve distance calculation between two places using Google Maps or Open Maps API, in my case I've used the Google Maps API. 

## Tech Stack & Usage
This is an ionic framework based react app. 
In order to run this application, make sure you have installed Ionic CLI on your system, before importing this project. 
Once ready, you can simply go to your project directory run the installation using npm command: 
```bash
npm i
```
Followed by starting the ionic server using: 
```bash
ionic serve
```

## Design and project structure

This is a very basic react application with just 2 page components namely-
1. Home - to ask user for source and destination
2. Result - to show the resulting places on map along with it's distance. 

Keeping everything simple and easy to understand will help any future developer to enhance on this project.
